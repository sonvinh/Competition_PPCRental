	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

Background: 
	Given the following property
	| PropertyName                   | Content                                                 | Price| PropertyType	| District   | UserID   | StatusID |

Scenario: Successfull Creating New Property
	When I input the following information
	| PropertyName        | Content | Price | PropertyType | District | UserID | StatusID |
	| New Create Property | Example | 1200  | 1            | 2        | 1      | 3        |
	Then the list of books should update
	| PropertyName                   | Content                                                 | Price| PropertyType	| District   | UserID   | StatusID |
